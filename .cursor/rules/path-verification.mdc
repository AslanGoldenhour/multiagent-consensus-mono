# Path Verification Rules

## Always Check Current Directory

Before executing terminal commands or creating/modifying files, **ALWAYS** check your current directory:

1. Run `pwd` to verify the current working directory
2. Only after confirming the correct location, proceed with command execution or file operations
3. If the directory is incorrect, use `cd` to navigate to the correct location

## Terminal Commands

When executing terminal commands:

- Verify the directory context before running ANY command
- Use absolute paths when changing directories to avoid ambiguity
- After changing directories, check the new location with `pwd`
- When executing package-specific commands, make sure you're in the correct package directory

## File Operations

When creating or modifying files:

- Always verify the full path of the file before reading/writing
- Use the full path in your file operations
- Double-check that new files are being created in the correct location
- When creating configuration files or documentation, ensure they follow the project structure

## When Working With Packages

For package-specific operations:

- Verify you're in the correct package directory (e.g., `packages/multiagent-discussion/`)
- Check that files are created in the correct package directory
- Package-specific commands (like `pnpm test`) should be run from the package directory

## Error Recovery

If you find yourself in the wrong directory:

1. Use `pwd` to determine current location
2. Use `cd /absolute/path/to/correct/directory` to navigate to the right place
3. Verify with `pwd` that you've reached the correct location
4. Only then proceed with your intended operations
