# Documentation Workflow Rules

## Update Sequence

When working with documentation, always follow this sequence:

1. First update `instructions/agent_memory.md` with technical details
2. Then update `instructions/project_plan.md` to mark tasks complete
3. Finally update `README.md` with user-facing changes and metrics

## Documentation Content

Ensure each documentation file maintains its purpose:

- **Agent Memory**: Technical details, decisions, and implementation notes
- **Project Plan**: Task tracking, progress updates, and roadmap
- **README**: User-facing overview, metrics, and status badges

## Metrics Updates

Before updating the README with badges or metrics:

1. Run tests to get current coverage: `cd packages/multiagent-discussion && pnpm test`
2. Count source lines of code: `find packages -type f -name "*.ts" | xargs wc -l | sort -nr`
3. Update badges to reflect current values

## Commit Guidelines

Use clear commit messages for documentation updates:
- "Update agent memory with [feature] implementation details"
- "Update project plan to mark [feature] as completed"
- "Update README with current metrics and status"
