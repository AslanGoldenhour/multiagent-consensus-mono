A comprehensive monorepo structure for developing and managing multi-agent consensus systems, with a focus on consensus mechanisms for LLMs.

## 📋 Overview

This monorepo contains packages and applications for building multi-agent systems:

- **packages/multiagent-consensus**: A framework for running consensus processes between multiple LLMs
- **apps/web**: A Next.js web application for visualizing and interacting with multi-agent systems

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or later)
- npm (v8.0.0 or later)
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiagent-consensus-mono.git
cd multiagent-consensus-mono
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
# Copy environment files for development
cp .env.development .env
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local to add your private API keys
```

4. Run the development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Environment Structure

This project uses a structured approach to environment variables:

- `.env` - Base variables used across all environments (safe to commit)
- `.env.development` - Development-specific variables (safe to commit)
- `.env.production` - Production-specific variables (safe to commit)
- `.env.local` - Private variables like API keys (never commit these)

## 📦 Packages

### multiagent-consensus

A framework for running multi-agent consensus processes using multiple LLMs. Features include:

- Support for multiple consensus methods (majority, supermajority, unanimous)
- Configurable debate rounds
- Detailed metadata and logging
- Support for multiple LLM providers (via Vercel AI SDK)

## 💻 Applications

### Web Dashboard

A Next.js web application for:

- Configuring and running consensus debates
- Visualizing debate results and process
- Managing API keys and providers
- Viewing logs and history
