# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

This project is all about building an NPM library that acts like a digital jury of multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). Developers can plug in the library into their projects, supply it with different LLMs and their API keys, and let these LLMs debate on a given query to produce the best possible answer. The library will let users specify preferences such as system prompts, different bias presets, and even custom voices for the models so that the debate can be tailored for various scenarios—whether for clear-cut problems like arithmetic or complex questions like policy decisions.

The library is being built to bring together the strengths of different LLMs through a consensus mechanism, mitigating any single model’s bias. It helps developers integrate multi-agent debate that can yield a more robust, nuanced response than relying on one LLM. Key objectives include secure API key management, configurable output formats (plain text, JSON, or detailed conversation threads), and a framework that supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations while keeping the debate process transparent and fully logged.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

- A robust NPM module for multi-agent LLM debates integrated via a configuration object.
- Usage of environment variables (via a package like dotenv) to securely handle API keys.
- Support for multiple LLM providers using the Vercel AI SDK.
- A configurable system that allows setting presets for biases/voices or customizing them through configuration.
- Flexible output options, including a single best answer, detailed chat thread history, or JSON structured output with metadata (models used, processing time, token counts, debate rounds, and self-assessed confidence ratings).
- Implementation of a debate management flow with configurable rounds, consensus mechanisms (simple majority, super majority, or unanimous).
- Integration of durability measures (using Inngest) to handle API rate limits and failures gracefully.
- A visual dashboard UI (using Next.js and Tailwind CSS) for inspecting call histories, logging details, and flagging responses.
- A monorepo setup (using Turbo Repo) to house both the core NPM library and the dashboard UI.
- A higher-level user-friendly interface for non-developers where they can set API keys and watch as the jury debates. (LOWEST priority)

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Extensive support for providers beyond what the Vercel AI SDK directly supports in its initial version.
- Advanced analytics beyond logging and basic debugging tools.
- Custom integrations with external platforms outside the scope of the NPM module and dashboard UI.

## 3. User Flow

A developer begins by setting up the environment for the library. First, they create a configuration file (.env) to securely store API keys and any custom parameters. After installing the module, the developer instantiates it by passing in a configuration object. This object determines the set of LLMs to be used, selects bias presets or custom configurations, and sets preferences for output formats and debate settings (such as the maximum number of rounds and consensus method).

Once configured, the developer sends a query to the library. This query triggers the multi-agent debate workflow where each LLM processes the input and either works simultaneously or in a multi-threaded turn-based manner. As the debate unfolds, the system collects responses, initiates follow-up rounds if needed to reach consensus, and logs each step. Finally, the chosen output is returned as an object, complete with metadata (models used, processing time, token counts, etc.) and the final answer in the desired format.

## 4. Core Features

- **Configuration Management:**

  - Use of environmental files (.env) and configuration objects to manage API keys, LLM selections, bias presets, and other options.
  - Ability to use defaults, presets (like right-wing, left-wing, centrist, PhD, high school), or completely custom prompts.

- **Multi-Agent Debate System:**

  - Simultaneous or multi-threaded debates by multiple LLMs on a given query.
  - Configurable consensus mechanisms (simple majority, super majority, unanimous) and ability to cap the number of debate rounds.
  - Options for binary or complex queries with adaptive debate flow.

- **Output Configurability:**

  - Flexible output options: single best answer, detailed debate history/chat thread, or summarized versions.
  - Structured output as an object including metadata such as models used, processing duration, token counts, debate rounds, and self-assessed confidence ratings.

- **Secure API Key Management:**

  - Integration with dotenv for secure environment variable handling.
  - Guidelines for key rotation, limited permission settings, and risk mitigation.

- **Durability and Asynchronous Operations:**

  - Utilization of Inngest for managing failures and rate limits gracefully.
  - Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operation modes.
  - Streaming chat responses with multi-threaded initial query handling and turn-by-turn debate rounds.

- **Visual Dashboard:**

  - A UI built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for inspecting call histories, flagging responses, and debugging the debate process.
  - Logging interface that captures all debate iterations for transparency and review.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frontend:**

  - Next.js: Framework for building the visual dashboard.
  - Tailwind CSS: Utilized for styling the UI components.
  - ShadCN: Portal

- **Backend & Core Library:**

  - Node.js and NPM: The library itself will be developed as an NPM package.
  - Vercel AI SDK: To support multiple LLM providers.
  - dotenv: For securely loading configuration and API keys.
  - Inngest: To manage asynchronous operations, durability, error-handling, and rate limits.
  - Turbo Repo: For maintaining a monorepo architecture that includes both the core NPM module and the dashboard UI.

- **AI Models & Plugins:**

  - Claude 3.7 Sonnet: One of the primary LLMs integrated.
  - Other models through the Vercel AI SDK (e.g., OpenAI, etc.).
  - Cursor: For advanced AI-powered coding suggestions and real-time developer support.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**

  - The library should have configurable limits on the number of debate rounds to prevent long processing times.
  - Support for streaming responses to keep UI feedback fluid.
  - Optimal use of multi-threaded processing where possible, with fallback to turn-by-turn evaluations.

- **Security:**

  - Secure management of API keys using environment variables.
  - Compliance with best practices for key rotation and permission restrictions.
  - Ensure data passed between modules and UI is encrypted where required.

- **Usability:**

  - Intuitive configuration with clear defaults and presets.
  - Consistent, structured output that always returns an object with necessary metadata.
  - A simple and clean dashboard UI for visual feedback and logging.

- **Reliability:**

  - Durability tools (using Inngest) to gracefully manage failures, rate limits, and API timeouts.
  - Logging and error-handling mechanisms for tracking the debate process.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- The project assumes that developers integrating the library have basic Node.js and NPM experience.
- The library is built primarily for developers; advanced user interface options for non-developers will be a future extension.
- LLM responses and the debate process may be inherently slower than traditional methods—the performance bottleneck is expected to be the LLMs themselves.
- The multi-agent debate mechanism relies on the availability and responsiveness of external LLM providers (as managed through the Vercel AI SDK).
- It is assumed that environmental files will be used for API keys and that sensible defaults are maintained for bias presets.
- The project depends on the availability of tools like Inngest, Turbo Repo, and the Vercel AI SDK for proper operation.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **API Rate Limits & Latency:**

  - LLM providers may impose rate limits, leading to delays or failures. Utilize Inngest to handle these gracefully.
  - The inherent latency of multiple LLMs debating might affect overall response time—configurable debate rounds can help mitigate this.

- **Consensus Complexity:**

  - Defining a fair and accurate consensus mechanism (simple majority vs. super majority vs. unanimous) might pose challenges. Debug logs and a detailed debate history help in fine-tuning this approach.

- **Configurable Biases:**

  - Providing too much customization (multiple presets and custom prompts) might lead to inconsistent debate outputs. Clear defaults and a robust validation process within the configuration setup can help avoid ambiguity.

- **Asynchronous Handling:**

  - Handling both synchronous and asynchronous operations might introduce concurrency issues. Proper error handling and state management are critical, especially in multi-threaded scenarios.

- **UI and Logging Integration:**

  - Keeping the dashboard and logging system in sync with the backend debates could be challenging. A well-defined API between the core module and the UI layer is recommended.

- **Open Source Contributions:**

  - As the project is open source, maintaining consistency and quality across contributed code will require strict guidelines and possibly enforced linting and code review processes.

This PRD provides a complete, unambiguous guide for the project, ensuring that subsequent technical documents (tech stack details, frontend guidelines, backend structure, app flow, etc.) can be generated without any confusion. Every aspect from configuration, multi-agent debates, output handling, security practices, and performance considerations has been addressed to serve as the main reference for the project development.
