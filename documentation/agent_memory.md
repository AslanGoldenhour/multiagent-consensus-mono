# Agent Memory: Multiagent-Consensus-Mono Repository

## Project Overview

This repository is a monorepo structure for developing and managing multi-agent consensus systems. It follows code quality standards with automated linting and formatting on commit.

## Technical Memory

### Repository Structure

- Root directory contains configuration files for linting, formatting, and TypeScript
- `documentation/` contains project requirements and technical documentation
- `packages/` directory contains individual packages/services of the system
  - `multiagent-consensus/` contains the consensus engine package for multi-agent debates
    - `examples/` contains example implementations for package usage
- `apps/` directory contains frontend applications
  - `web/` contains the Next.js web application
- `.cursor/rules/` contains coding standards and workflow rules

### Development Environment

- Using git for version control
- Node.js (>=18.0.0) as the runtime environment
- TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript development
- Husky for git hooks integration
- ESLint v8 for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and test coverage on every commit
- TurboRepo for monorepo management
- Jest for unit testing

### Code Quality Standards

- ESLint configuration for JavaScript and TypeScript files
- Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting
- Husky pre-commit hooks that run lint-staged and tests
- Lint-staged configuration to format and lint only staged files
- Jest unit tests with TypeScript support

### Package Structure

#### multiagent-consensus

The multiagent-consensus package implements a framework for running multi-agent consensus processes:

- `src/consensus/` contains the consensus engine and methods
- `src/types/` contains TypeScript interfaces and types
- `src/providers/` contains LLM provider implementations
- `src/utils/` contains utility functions
- `src/__tests__/` contains unit tests organized by module
- `examples/` contains example usage of the package
- `dist/` contains compiled JavaScript code for distribution

#### web (Next.js Application)

The web application is built with:

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- ESLint for code quality

### Consensus Methods

The package implements three consensus methods:

- **Majority**: Requires more than 50% of responses to agree
- **Supermajority**: Requires at least 75% of responses to agree (updated from 2/3)
- **Unanimous**: Requires all responses to agree

### Error Handling & Validation System

We've implemented a comprehensive error handling and validation system for the package:

- **Base Error Hierarchy**:

  - `ConsensusError`: Base class for all errors in the system
  - `ConfigurationError`: For invalid configuration parameters
  - `ProviderError`: For issues with LLM providers
  - `ConsensusProcessError`: For errors during consensus process
  - `ValidationError`: For input validation failures
  - `EnvironmentError`: For environment variable issues

- **Factory Methods**: Each error class has factory methods for common error scenarios, making error creation consistent and self-documenting.

- **Error Handling Utility**: The `handleError` function standardizes error handling throughout the codebase, ensuring all errors are wrapped as appropriate ConsensusError types.

- **Validation System**: A comprehensive validation utility with methods for:
  - `notEmpty`: Ensures values are not null, undefined, or empty
  - `isType`: Type validation for inputs
  - `inRange`: Range validation for numeric values
  - `oneOf`: Validation against a set of allowed values
  - `modelName`: Specific validation for model names
  - `consensusConfig`: Validation for configuration objects

### Environment Variable Management

We've implemented a robust environment variable management system using a structured approach:

- **EnvManager Singleton**: Provides a centralized place for accessing environment variables
- **Custom Path Support**: Allows loading from a specified .env file path
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Attempts loading from common locations if no path is specified
- **Default Values**: Support for default values when environment variables are not defined
- **Required Variables**: Special handling for required environment variables
- **Provider API Key Management**: Specialized support for managing provider API keys with appropriate error handling
- **Initialization Handling**: Designed to initialize only once and handle initialization errors gracefully

#### Environment Files Structure

We use a tiered approach to environment variables:

- **`.env`**: Base variables shared across all environments (committed to repo)
- **`.env.development`**: Development-specific settings (committed to repo)
- **`.env.production`**: Production-specific settings (committed to repo)
- **`.env.local`**: Private API keys and secrets (never committed, added to .gitignore)
- **`packages/multiagent-consensus/examples/.env.example`**: Example file showing package configuration options

This structure provides clear separation between:

- Public configuration (safe to commit)
- Environment-specific settings (safe to commit)
- Private secrets (never committed)

### Provider System Enhancements

- **Extended Provider Support**: Expanded support for all Vercel AI SDK provider packages
- **Custom Provider Registration**: Added ability to register custom providers at runtime
- **API Key Validation**: Added validation for provider API keys before attempting to use a provider
- **Generic Fallback Provider**: Implemented a generic provider as a fallback when no suitable providers are available
- **Dynamic Provider Loading**: Enhanced provider loading to dynamically load only installed and configured providers
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for provider-related issues

### Testing Approach

We've implemented a comprehensive testing strategy:

- **Unit Tests**: Focused tests for each module
- **Mocking Strategy**:
  - Environment variables mocked to allow testing without actual .env files
  - Dynamic imports mocked to avoid actual network calls
  - Provider packages mocked to simulate installed/uninstalled packages
  - Console output mocked to reduce noise in test output
- **Test Isolation**: Registry state reset between tests to prevent test pollution
- **Test Coverage**: Aiming for 100% coverage of utility files
- **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests before implementing features to ensure quality
