# Agent Memory: Multiagent-Mono Repository

## Project Overview

This repository is a monorepo structure for developing and managing multi-agent systems. It follows code quality standards with automated linting and formatting on commit.

## Technical Memory

### Repository Structure

- Root directory contains configuration files for linting, formatting, and TypeScript
- `documentation/` contains project requirements and technical documentation
- `packages/` directory will contain individual packages/services of the system
- `.cursor/rules/` contains coding standards and workflow rules

### Development Environment

- Using git for version control
- Node.js (>=18.0.0) as the runtime environment
- TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript development
- Husky for git hooks integration
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality on every commit

### Code Quality Standards

- ESLint configuration for JavaScript and TypeScript files
- Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting
- Husky pre-commit hooks that run lint-staged
- Lint-staged configuration to format and lint only staged files

## Implementation Progress

### Completed

- [x] Initial repository setup
- [x] Basic folder structure creation
- [x] Git initialization
- [x] Development environment configuration
- [x] Code quality tools integration (Husky, ESLint, Prettier)
- [x] Pre-commit hooks for automated linting and formatting

### In Progress

- [ ] Package structure definition
- [ ] Core libraries and services identification
- [ ] Frontend framework selection
- [ ] Backend architecture design

### Planned

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Testing framework integration
- [ ] Documentation site development
- [ ] First package implementation
