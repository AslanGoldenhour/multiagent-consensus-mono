# Agent Memory: Multiagent-Consensus-Mono Repository

## Project Overview

This repository is a monorepo structure for developing and managing multi-agent consensus systems. It follows code quality standards with automated linting and formatting on commit.

## Technical Memory

### Repository Structure

- Root directory contains configuration files for linting, formatting, and TypeScript
- `documentation/` contains project requirements and technical documentation
- `packages/` directory contains individual packages/services of the system
  - `multiagent-consensus/` contains the consensus engine package for multi-agent debates
    - `examples/` contains example implementations for package usage
- `apps/` directory contains frontend applications
  - `web/` contains the Next.js web application
- `.cursor/rules/` contains coding standards and workflow rules

### Development Environment

- Using git for version control
- Node.js (>=18.0.0) as the runtime environment
- TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript development
- Husky for git hooks integration
- ESLint v8 for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and test coverage on every commit
- TurboRepo for monorepo management
- Jest for unit testing

### Code Quality Standards

- ESLint configuration for JavaScript and TypeScript files
- Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting
- Husky pre-commit hooks that run lint-staged and tests
- Lint-staged configuration to format and lint only staged files
- Jest unit tests with TypeScript support

### Package Structure

#### multiagent-consensus

The multiagent-consensus package implements a framework for running multi-agent consensus processes:

- `src/consensus/` contains the consensus engine and methods
- `src/types/` contains TypeScript interfaces and types
- `src/providers/` contains LLM provider implementations
- `src/utils/` contains utility functions
- `src/__tests__/` contains unit tests organized by module
- `examples/` contains example usage of the package
- `dist/` contains compiled JavaScript code for distribution

#### web (Next.js Application)

The web application is built with:

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- ESLint for code quality

### Consensus Methods

The package implements three consensus methods:

- **Majority**: Requires more than 50% of responses to agree
- **Supermajority**: Requires at least 75% of responses to agree (updated from 2/3)
- **Unanimous**: Requires all responses to agree
