# Agent Memory: Multiagent-Mono Repository

## Project Overview

This repository is a monorepo structure for developing and managing multi-agent systems. It follows code quality standards with automated linting and formatting on commit.

## Technical Memory

### Repository Structure

- Root directory contains configuration files for linting, formatting, and TypeScript
- `documentation/` contains project requirements and technical documentation
- `packages/` directory contains individual packages/services of the system
  - `multiagent-consensus/` contains the consensus engine package for multi-agent debates
- `apps/` directory contains frontend applications
  - `web/` contains the Next.js web application
- `.cursor/rules/` contains coding standards and workflow rules

### Development Environment

- Using git for version control
- Node.js (>=18.0.0) as the runtime environment
- TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript development
- Husky for git hooks integration
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality on every commit
- TurboRepo for monorepo management

### Code Quality Standards

- ESLint configuration for JavaScript and TypeScript files
- Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting
- Husky pre-commit hooks that run lint-staged
- Lint-staged configuration to format and lint only staged files

### Package Structure

#### multiagent-consensus

The multiagent-consensus package implements a framework for running multi-agent consensus processes:

- `src/consensus/` contains the consensus engine and methods
- `src/types/` contains TypeScript interfaces and types
- `src/providers/` contains LLM provider implementations
- `src/utils/` contains utility functions

#### web (Next.js Application)

The web application is built with:

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- ESLint for code quality

## Implementation Progress

### Completed

- [x] Initial repository setup
- [x] Basic folder structure creation
- [x] Git initialization
- [x] Development environment configuration
- [x] Code quality tools integration (Husky, ESLint, Prettier)
- [x] Pre-commit hooks for automated linting and formatting
- [x] Setup of the consensus package structure
- [x] Implementation of consensus methods (majority, supermajority, unanimous)
- [x] Creation of basic type definitions for the consensus engine
- [x] Setup of provider interfaces for LLM integration
- [x] Creation of a Next.js web application
- [x] Creation of comprehensive folder structure documentation
- [x] Creation of a phased implementation checklist

### In Progress

- [ ] Implementation of proper error handling and validation in the consensus package
- [ ] Integration with Vercel AI SDK for LLM providers
- [ ] Setting up unit testing with Jest
- [ ] Development of UI components for the web application

### Planned

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Testing framework integration
- [ ] API routes implementation
- [ ] Documentation site development
- [ ] Integration of packages with the web application
