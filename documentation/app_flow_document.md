# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a developer or user first encounters the multi-agent NPM library project, they begin their journey by visiting a dedicated landing page hosted as part of the open-source project. This landing page introduces the project, outlines key capabilities, and provides easy access to documentation and setup guides. For developers, the initial step involves following a quick-start tutorial that demonstrates how to install the library via npm and configure it using environment variables for secure API key management. In the future, if the project extends to a user-friendly visual interface for non-developers, users will be able to create an account by signing up with email or trusted social logins. The sign-in process for these users is straightforward and includes options to recover lost passwords through a simple reset flow. Once signed in, users can easily log out and later sign in again, ensuring that both developers and non-developers experience a seamless entry point into the application.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After authentication, the main dashboard or home page is the central hub from which users navigate the application. For developers integrating the library, the dashboard provides a clear overview that includes quick links to configuration options, recent activity or debate history, and visual metrics summarizing previous query responses. The main interface boasts a clean design with a header that displays the project name, a sidebar containing navigation links to different features such as live debate sessions, historical logs, and system settings, and central widgets that highlight current system status, performance details, and a summary of recent interactions with the multi-agent debate process. Whether the user is inspecting a live query or reviewing detailed logs for debugging purposes, transitioning from the main dashboard to any specific tool or feature is accomplished with intuitive clicks and seamless page transitions.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The core functionality of the application is centered on the multi-agent debate feature. Developers start by configuring the library via a configuration file or dynamic configuration parameters during module instantiation. This configuration includes selecting which language models participate in the debate, setting their biases or custom voices, and choosing the output format; options can range from a single consolidated answer to a detailed chat thread complete with metadata such as chosen models, token counts, and debate rounds. Once the configuration is complete, a user on the dashboard can submit a question or query which triggers the debate process. The system is designed to either run multiple models in parallel or execute turn-based multi-threaded debate sessions, with each LLM providing its response based on the given parameters. The transitions between these stages are smooth. After submitting a query, the user is taken to a live debate view where the progress is visualized in real time and details such as discussion rounds, model responses, and confidence ratings are displayed. Following the live session, the final output is neatly assembled in an object form and displayed along with an option to view an extended history of the debate discussions. Advanced workflows also include features like stopping the debate early or setting a maximum number of debate rounds, ensuring that performance is balanced with thorough analysis.

## Settings and Account Management

The settings and account management flow provides both developers and future non-developer users with the tools to customize their experience and secure their accounts. Developers using the library can update configuration settings for API keys, debate parameters, and output preferences directly within the development environment by editing the environmental configuration files. Simultaneously, the dashboard offers a settings page where users can adjust notification preferences, manage security settings, and review logs. For those using the UI, account management is straightforward with options to update profile details, change passwords, and review subscription or billing information if additional premium features are added later. Once the adjustments are made, the user can easily navigate back to the main dashboard, ensuring a consistent and predictable experience regardless of the configuration changes made through the settings portal.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Error states are carefully handled throughout the application to ensure that any disruptions in the multi-agent debate process or UI transitions do not break the overall user experience. If a user submits a query with missing or invalid data, clear and concise error messages appear on the screen along with guidance on how to correct the issue. In cases where network connectivity is lost or one or more of the language models fails to provide a response due to rate limits or other operational hiccups, the system leverages durability tools like Inngest to manage these errors gracefully. The error messages are designed to be informative, so users understand whether they should retry the query, check their configuration settings, or examine the log entries for further detail. Alternate paths exist within specialized views on the dashboard that allow users to inspect error logs and access troubleshooting documentation, ensuring that they can always regain a normal flow and continue using the application.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall journey through the application is structured to guide the user from an initial discovery phase to advanced multi-agent debate interactions, ensuring that every step is clear and well-connected. Developers begin on the landing page, install and configure the NPM library with their API keys from environment variables, and proceed to a main dashboard that offers both real-time and historical insights into the debate process. Each query is processed through a series of well-planned steps including live execution, potential additional rounds, and detailed logging, allowing users to retrieve final answers along with comprehensive metadata. The settings and account management pages ensure that users maintain control over their preferences and security, while robust error handling and alternate paths guarantee that any issues are managed with clarity and prompt guidance. Together, these features form a holistic and transparent application experience that is designed to be both developer-friendly and adaptable for future non-developer interfaces.
