# Backend Structure Document

This document provides an overview of the backend structure for the Multi-agent LLM Jury NPM Library. It breaks down the architecture, database solutions, API design, hosting, infrastructure, security, and maintenance aspects using everyday language.

## 1. Backend Architecture

The backend is built on a modular Node.js environment structured within a monorepo using Turbo Repo. This allows for easy sharing of code across the NPM package and the Next.js dashboard UI. Key design patterns include:

- **Modularity:** Components such as configuration loading, debate logic, error handling, and logging are separated into distinct modules.
- **Scalability:** Built on Node.js and supported by tools like Inngest for asynchronous tasks, the system can manage increased loads and traffic without major rewrites.
- **Maintainability:** The clear separation of concerns (configuration, API integration, debate management, and UI data logging) ensures that updates or new features can be integrated smoothly.

Tech stack used on the backend includes:

- Node.js
- dotenv
- Vercel AI SDK
- Inngest

## 2. Database Management

While the core library does not require a database for its primary function of facilitating debates, the dashboard UI and logging components do benefit from data persistence. Some potential uses include:

- **Call History Storage:** Storing debate queries, responses, and metadata for review on the dashboard.
- **Logging and Debugging:** Recording errors, performance metrics, and decision-making traces to help diagnose issues and refine the system.

Possible database technologies include:

- **SQL Databases:** For structured and relational call history data (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- **NoSQL Databases:** For storing flexible log data and semi-structured records (e.g., MongoDB).

Standard data management practices, such as data backup, indexing, and normalization, will be followed to ensure performance and reliability.

## 3. Database Schema

Even though the core system is library-based, here's a human-readable view of potential database schemas for components like call history and logs if a SQL database like PostgreSQL is chosen.

### Human-Readable Schema Description:

- **Call History Table:** Stores each debate session with fields such as a unique identifier, timestamp, query, models used, tokens statistics, debate rounds, and a summary of responses.
- **Logs Table:** Keeps track of errors and events corresponding to specific debate sessions, including timestamps and error details.

### Sample SQL Schema (PostgreSQL):

-- Table: call_history

• id: Primary key, unique identifier for each debate session.
• query: The question or prompt posed to the LLMs.
• response: The final output (could be a single answer, chat transcript, or JSON format).
• models_used: A list of the LLM providers engaged in the debate.
• tokens: Token usage details for each model.
• debate_rounds: Number indicating the rounds of debate.
• created_at: Timestamp when the record was created.

-- Table: logs

• id: Primary key, unique identifier for each log entry.
• call_history_id: Foreign key linking to the call_history table.
• error_message: Description of any error encountered.
• event_details: Additional log information such as API call information or debugging data.
• logged_at: Timestamp of the log entry.

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

The backend exposes a set of RESTful APIs for both the library’s functionality and the dashboard UI. The API endpoints are designed to be clear, straightforward, and intuitive:

- **POST /debate:**
  - Purpose: Accepts a query and configuration details to initiate a multi-agent debate.
  - Returns: The debate result, including the chosen answer, metadata about the models, tokens used, and confidence rating.

- **GET /history:**
  - Purpose: Retrieves past debate sessions with their metadata for analysis and review in the dashboard UI.
  - Returns: A list of call history records.

- **POST /config:**
  - Purpose: Allows dynamic updating of configuration settings (e.g., LLM biases, debate rounds) using custom presets.
  - Returns: Confirmation of updated settings.

- **GET /status:**
  - Purpose: A health-check endpoint to verify that the backend services are operational.
  - Returns: Current status, uptime, and any active alerts.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

The backend is set up on a cloud-based hosting platform to ensure reliability, scalability, and cost efficiency. Key points include:

- **Cloud Provider:** Likely Vercel (or a similar provider) for hosting both the Node.js backend and Next.js dashboard UI, ensuring a unified deployment pipeline.
- **Benefits:**
  - Easy scaling to handle spikes in API calls.
  - Integrated CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.
  - Edge network support for faster response times globally.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

Several components work together to ensure smooth backend operation:

- **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming requests evenly across backend instances to prevent overload.
- **Caching Mechanisms:** Use caching at application or CDN levels to reduce response times, especially for repetitive requests.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Leverage Vercel’s edge network to deliver static assets and improve latency for users worldwide.
- **Asynchronous Task Manager:** Inngest handles rate limits, retries, and failures in asynchronous tasks such as debate rounds and streaming responses.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is a core concern because the project handles sensitive API keys and could be integrated into various applications. Security practices include:

- **API Key Management:** Using an `.env` file with the dotenv package to keep API keys and environment-specific secrets secure.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Although the initial library may not include a user login system, when extended to a full dashboard UI, proper authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth or JWT) will be put into place to restrict access.
- **Data Encryption:** HTTPS will be used to encrypt data in transit, and sensitive data may be stored in encrypted formats if required.
- **Rate Limiting and Error Handling:** Implemented via Inngest to safeguard against abuse and provide graceful degradation.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure that the backend remains healthy and performs optimally:

- **Monitoring Tools:** Tools such as Vercel’s built-in monitoring, along with third-party services (e.g., Sentry or New Relic), will be used to track performance, errors, and system logs.
- **Maintenance Strategies:** Regular updates and automated CI/CD pipelines will be set up to deploy fixes and updates rapidly. Scheduled health checks and alert systems will notify developers of any issues before they affect end-users.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

To summarize, the backend for the Multi-agent LLM Jury NPM Library is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure. The architecture utilizes a monorepo with Turbo Repo, making it easier to manage multiple components (the core NPM package and the dashboard UI) concurrently. Key takeaways include:

- A modular, Node.js-based backend with clear separation for configuration, debate logic, logging, and error handling.
- A choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depending on the storage needs for call history and logs.
- RESTful APIs that facilitate smooth communication between the frontend and the backend.
- Cloud hosting (likely on Vercel) that ensures scalability, reliability, and ease of deployment.
- Robust security measures, including safe API key management, rate limiting, and encrypted data transmission.
- Comprehensive monitoring and maintenance practices to keep the system healthy and up-to-date.

This backend setup is designed to support developers by providing a reliable, high-performing system that facilitates multi-agent debates among LLMs, with the flexibility to evolve as project requirements grow.
